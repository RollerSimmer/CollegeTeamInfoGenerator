-- today --
(add things done here)

-- to-do --
- when building names, be sure to select state first, then city,
  then public or private, and finally regional, urban or flagship 
  (if public), or denominational or secular (if private)
- when city, state, and public/private and denominatonal/secular
  are selected, make name with them as arguments or data members 
  in a name builder class.  
- (optional) make acronyms/initialisms for long school names
- display the generated team list as a group of JavaFX controls, 
  as well as a data list in a text box
* finish college team information factory
- when loading a file, if no operators are found, just add randomly 
  weighted entries for each operator, or come up with 
  hard coded weights
- when loading a file, if no affiliations are found, just 
  add randomly weighted entries for each operator, or 
  come up with hard coded weights
* change state ID to mappable two-letter state abbrevation string to make
  loading from XML simpler
* load city list before state list so states know what city IDs 
  are
